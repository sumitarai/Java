Testing - requirements meet the expectations.


defect - when that doesn't happen.



Software Testing - 


Automation - replacing man with a machine




Regression testing - u test the application again and again, with every build release

to ensure that the sanity of the application is maintained.


repeatition - ideal candidates for test automation



100% test automation possible?


50-60% of test automation is possible 




Selenium - rather a combination of test automation tools. 




IDE - record and playback which works only with the firefox browser.


Selenium Rc - selenium remote control.  client server technology

3 way handshake

proxy server which gets injected in the browser. and via this the client sends the requests to

the proxy server which then automates the browser.



Selenium RC  is same for all browsers - FF, IE, Chrome, Safari



WebDriver - that thje browser own API itself has the capability to automate the browser. so its is a 

direct handshake


Each browser has got its own webdriver -

FF, IE, Chrome, Safari




Selenium Grid - allows us to run the test in parallel - at the same time more than one test

in more that one system browser combination can be executed
